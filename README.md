## Overview
In this project, you will be creating a project with your partner! We are looking for ideas for a new KTP Product, The only thing is We do not know what we want to create. You and your partner will create a repository to work together. You are tasked to create anything from a simple vending machine, a password checker, or a simple HTML page! As part of the development process, we have organized our team into potential groups, each responsible for a key aspect of the product:

1. **New Feature Development Team:**
   - This team is focused on implementing a new idea or creating a product.

2. **Website Landing Page Team:**
   - The Website Landing Page Team is responsible for creating a landing page for your "New Product" you have in mind, showcasing its features and enticing potential customers. Use any resources needed.

## Possible Files to create:
- **new_feature:** Use wtv language to create your product's design and functionalities.
- **landing_page:** Demo Website Landing Page. index.html. If you want to focus on building the website for your imaginary product, build the website here! 

## Getting Started & Next Steps
1. **Choose a Partner and a Task to work on:**
   - Work together with your team member to divide and Conquer your task whether it's the new product or landing page.
   - Use Git to collaborate effectively by creating branches, adding, pushing, committing changes, and resolving merge conflicts.
     
2. **Create a repo for you and your partner**
   - One person in each pair should create the repo, add collaborators
   - open it on their local like we did
   - the person should clone into it and work from there

3. **Create a Branch**
   - create a branch for you to do your work on
   - You should both have your own branch
   - call it the task you are doing with your first name.
   -  ex: WEB-karla, FEATURE-karla
   -  you will be merging with your partner (merge WEB-partner) and working together on the file
     
6. **Create a file**
   - One partner will create a file (touch) and push it the repo
   - The other partner should be able to pull it and work on it as well, pull often
   - work on that same doc
   - finish your Ticket/task, and push it to the Repo!
     
7. **Complete task**
   - You can create anything you want, it can be simple because we are practicing git commands
   - you may get merge conflicts, trouble seeing most recent files, etc, That's why we are practicing!
   - make sure you push it when done and commit the message with something like "final doc"
